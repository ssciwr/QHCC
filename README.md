Source code and example notebooks for the [Q-HCC website](https://ssciwr.github.io/QHCC).

## To build the website locally

```bash
pip install mkdocs-material
mkdocs serve
```

The website will then be served locally at http://127.0.0.1:8000/QHCC, and will be updated if any of the markdown files are edited.
